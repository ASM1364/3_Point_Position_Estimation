# 3_Point_Position_Estimation: In this exercise, we consider three sensor nodes located at arbitrary coordinates. 
The algorithm takes as inputs the coordinates and communication radius of these nodes. 
Our objective is to draw a triangle by connecting these three points. We will then draw 
perpendiculars from each side of the triangle, which intersect at a point denoted as Z. 
Our goal is to determine if point Z falls within the communication range of any of the nodes. 
The algorithm's output includes the coordinates of point Z, the number of nodes whose 
communication range includes Z (denoted as K), and the names of these nodes. Additionally, 
a graph illustrating the nodes and point Z is drawn on the coordinate axis.
